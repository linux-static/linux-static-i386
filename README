this repository tries to offer some statically linked linux apps.

coz sometimes there are situations when you either can't compile them yourself or get them from your distribution repo.
or you just dont have the time for it.

currently we feature goodies such as gcc 4.6.0 prebuilt.

all binaries are virus-checked with the latest kaspersky enterprise.
